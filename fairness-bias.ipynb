    "### **Sensitive Attribute (z) is age.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose age as our sensitive attribute because age correlates with differing financial behaviors and needs. For example, younger individuals typically require more liquidity and are less likely to commit to long-term savings products like bank term deposits due to their dynamic financial circumstances and greater likelihood of needing immediate access to cash. On the other hand, older individuals often have more financial stability and may be more inclined to lock in funds for a higher return. Additionally, many of the other features such as marital status, job type, if the customer has a housing loan or not, and much more are correlated to age.\n",
    "\n",
    "This naturally creates a potential for unfairness where models trained on historical data might inadvertently favor older clients while neglecting younger ones—even if the underlying behavior differences are statistically true on average. By focusing on age, we can analyze and quantify these disparities (e.g., through differences in true positive rates) and then apply fairness interventions to ensure that the model does not systematically disadvantage younger clients, making our results both interesting and practically relevant."

    "### **Discussion: Discuss which fairness metrics are specifically relevant to your task - Equal Opportunity**\n",
    "We chose equal opportunity as our primary fairness metric because it directly measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases (i.e., clients who subscribe to a term deposit) across different groups. From the perspective of the bank, we want to get as many customers to subscribe to a term deposit as possible. If a person would be interested to a term deposit, we want to ensure that we speak to them to secure the deposit. In contrast, it's OK if this comes a little bit at a cost of an increase in failed calls. In terms of our model, we want to increase the true positive rate (TPR) of the underserved group to match the better-served group. Ideally, we achieve this with minimal loss in accuracy (to prevent wasted time or marketing efforts). Additionally, we would not want to discriminate against younger clients, since they would potentially be ones to subscribe for longer and simply just developing long-term relationships with them could result in more buisiness in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our context, ensuring that the TPR is as close as possible for both the better-served group (e.g., older clients) and the underserved group (younger clients) is critical for guaranteeing equal opportunity. A low TPR difference indicates that clients with a genuine likelihood to subscribe are equally recognized by the model, regardless of their age. This metric is particularly relevant because misclassifying a true positive (especially for a group that might already be under-targeted) can lead to missed opportunities and potential discrimination. Using a ratio of the TPRs allows us to quantify fairness in a way that addresses the core objective of our predictive task.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on the ratio of the TPRs, we ensure that both older (protected) and younger (unprotected) clients who are truly eligible for the product are equally likely to be identified by the model, which maximizes the effects of the marketing campaign. Our argument emphasizes that, given the potential consequences for customer access and fairness in financial services, using the ratio of TPRs or equal opportunity as our fairness metric is not only justified but essential for the responsible and successful deployment of the predictive model."

    "### **Base Model - Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet defines a helper function, compute_group_rates, which calculates several performance metrics (TPR, FPR, TNR, and FNR) for a given subgroup in the test set based on the sensitive attribute Z. The function filters the test set based on whether the sensitive attribute matches the group value provided (in this case, 0 for the older group and 1 for the rest), and then computes the counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to derive the metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our results, our model achieves an total accuracy of approximately 84.4%, meaning it correctly predicts whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit about 84% of the time. When we break down the performance by the sensitive attribute—age—the \"Older\" group (clients with age values indicating they belong to group 0) shows a True Positive Rate (TPR) of about 87.5%, while the \"Younger\" group (group 1) has a TPR of approximately 81.8%. This indicates that the model correctly identifies positive cases (i.e., actual subscriptions) more often in the older group than in the younger group. The absolute TPR difference is around 5.72%, which indicates the model predicts older clients that subscribed correctly around 5.72% more than younger clients. Additionally, the older group also has a higher False Positive Rate (FPR) and correspondingly lower False Negative Rate (FNR) compared to the younger group. These disparities highlight that the model exhibits a bias favoring the older group. "

    "\n",
    "Since we chose to split on the 75th percentile of age, the younger category (clients under 48) is somewhat larger than the older category (clients 48 or above). From the baseline model, the older group obtains a TPR of 0.875 while the younger group obtains a TPR of 0.818, despite the younger group having 20841 more samples. Additionally, the FPR of the older group is higher than the younger group (0.182 vs 0.145). So, not only does the baseline model disproportionately predict the older group to subscribe correctly compared to the younger group, it also disproportionately predicts older people who did not end up subscribing as well. In general, it seems like the model is biased to predict older people as people who would subscribe to a term deposit regardless if they actually will in comparison to younger people."

    "### **How much can \"unfairness\" in your predictions be explained by dataset characteristics? Can you fix them with dataset-based interventions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The unfairness in the predictions can be explained by dataset characteristics. Firstly, there are many more people who are \"younger\" ($z=1$) in our dataset compared to older since we chose age by the dividing the groups on the 75th percentile of the dataset. Looking at the counts of people who subscribed, around 30% of people who subscribed ($y=1$) were \"older\" ($z=0$) and 70% of people who subscribed were \"younger\" ($z=1$). This is relatively close to the ratio of the groups as a whole. However, if we compared the percentage of older people that subscribed among all older people, it is slightly higher (around 13%) compared to younger people (around 11%). These ratios are quite close, but the data says that older people might be slightly more likely to subscribe compareed to younger people.\n",

    "\n",
    "By resampling our dataset, we were able to maintain the same accuracy of ~84%, but were able to improve the overall fairness since the difference in TPRs was 5.7% in the baseline model down to 2.7% if we use the dataset based intervention. While this improves the fairness, there is still a tradeoff in overall performance. The TPR for the $z=0$ group went down from ~87.5% to ~85%, but the TPR for the $z=1$ group improves from ~81.8% to ~82.3%. So, with this technique and parameter set-up, it is important to understand that we tradeoff performance for the $z=0$ group in order to boost the $z=1$ group."

    "### **How do different modeling choices impact fairness characteristics? Can you fix them with in-processing interventions?**\n",
    "Different modeling choices can impact fairness characteristics. The model architecture and optimization algorithms themselves can play a big role in the fairness (or unfairness) of the model. The model we chose was a simple logistic regression model, which tries to optimize some parameters by minimizing the log loss function. This minimizes the mean of the negative log-likelihoods. The dataset and optimization process chosen could guide the model toward some optimum that is unfair to the $z=1$ group in comparison to the $z=0$ group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this through model-based or inprocessing interventions, we applied a higher sample weight to each datapoint that was of the group ($z=1$ and $y=1$). Through the optimization process, it takes the training examples where the person is of the \"older\" group and subscribed to a term deposit and weights them larger in the overall cost function. Below, we simply just attached a larger weight of 1.25 to the ($z=1$ and $y=1$) group and left the sample weight of all other examples as 1.0. Then, we just provide the weights to the library function to weigh each respective example during training. We again use a LogisticRegression model optimized with these new sample weights."

    "Using just a single threshold, we observe that the overall accuracy decreased slightly to 81.3% from 84.4%. However, the intervention resulted in a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 91.6% for older clients and 86.1% for younger clients, leading to a TPR difference of 5.4 percentage points. The total TPR increased to 87.7% from 83.5% as well. This intervention however, does not improve the disparity in TPRs between the group much, so we went on to try a different approach. Below, we implemented a different decision threshold for each group and found two thresholds minimized the difference between the TPRs for each group, while maintained some level of total accuracy."

    "The results of using two thresholds gives us a TPR difference of 4.7%. This improves upon the baseline and the minor improvement that modifying a single threshold for both classes gave. However, as a tradeoff, we reduced the testing accuracy to 77.8% -- a 6.6% decrease in accuracy. So, this type of post-processing intervention doesn't quite improve the fairness as much as the previous interventions.\n",

This would help to improve the overall number of people who submit term deposits, especially in comparison to using a single threshold. However, it comes at a cost in lowering the model accuracy. The FPRs increase as well as an effect, which means we likely would result more failed calls than if you just used the baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, finetuning the thresholds alone as a post-processing interevention probably isn't the best method to improve the fairness of the model as the improved amount of fairness probably isn't worth the decrease in overall performance of the model in this case. Combined with other interventions like the model-based interventions, it could still be helpful."

    "For this task, all interventions could be realistic to implement. There are aren't any constraints that would prevent the bank from implementing a pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing model. So, the choice of intervention should look mostly at the results of each intervention and decide which tradeoffs you want to take. Assuming you only applied one intervention:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pre-processing intervention did a good job of decreasing the gap in TPRs between the two groups while maintaining accuracy. The tradeoff with them was that we decrease the number of correctly predicted examples from the older ($z=0$) group.\n",
    "- The in-processing intervention did a very similar job as the pre-processing intervention, but did not decrease the TPR of the older group, just increased the TPR of the younger group.\n",
    "- The post-processing intervention did the best at increasing the TPRs, but did worse in terms of fairness compared to the other interventions and greatly increased the FPRs for both groups and total accuracy as a result. This would result in more potentially wasted time in calls that do not result in a term deposit subscriber.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you had to only choose one intervention, in-processing probably improves the fairness the best while maintaining the other performance metrics like total accuracy. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that only one intervention is required. Combining both in-processing and post-processing could result in an even better result that improves fairness even more, while maintaining minimial loss in total accuracy."

    "The paper by Kamiran and Calders (2012) introduces several data preprocessing techniques aimed at addressing discrimination in classification tasks. The key contributions of this work include methods such as Massaging, Reweighing, and Sampling (both Uniform and Preferential Sampling). These techniques are specifically designed to adjust biased datasets in ways that significantly reduce discrimination while maintaining predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these methods, Preferential Sampling (PS) stands out as particularly effective. Preferential Sampling prioritizes modifying data instances that lie near the decision boundary, as these instances are more likely to influence the classifier's fairness. By selectively duplicating or removing data points closest to the decision boundary, PS achieves a more targeted reduction of discrimination compared to Uniform Sampling, which randomly samples data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Preferential Sampling (PS), data objects close to the decision boundary are identified as more susceptible to discriminatory outcomes. To identify these borderline instances, PS begins by learning a ranker from the training data, sorting data objects from DP (deprived-positive) and FP (favored-positive) groups in ascending order, and those from DN (deprived-negative) and FN (favored-negative) groups in descending order with respect to their positive class probability. This ranking ensures that elements at the top of the list are closest to the decision boundary. PS then iteratively duplicates instances closest to the boundary from the DP and FN groups to increase their representation, and removes instances closest to the boundary from the DN and FP groups to decrease their representation, achieving balanced groups."

    "In our implementation, we merged the original feature set (X_train) and labels (y_train) into a single DataFrame, facilitating joint analysis of sensitive group membership (z) and class labels (y). Next, the algorithm calculates specific sampling weights for each subgroup defined by combinations of the sensitive attribute (z) and class label (y). These weights determine how the dataset will be resampled to correct existing imbalances, ideally enhancing model fairness. After computing these weights, the code trains a baseline predictive model on the original dataset to obtain a score (probability) for each instance, indicating how confidently the model predicts the positive class. Using these scores, the dataset is partitioned into four distinct subsets according to sensitive group membership and class label combinations. The resampling process then selectively includes instances from each subgroup, prioritizing higher- or lower-ranked samples as dictated by the computed weights. Positive instances from the sensitive group (z=1) and negative instances from the non-sensitive group (z=0) are oversampled, while other subsets are adjusted accordingly, resulting in a preferentially sampled dataset (D_PS) intended to counteract bias. At the end, this preferentially sampled dataset is returned, separated back into feature and label arrays, ready for fairer downstream model training. We successfuly reproduced the code and results in similar results to those reported in the paper."

    "The results of applying Preferential Sampling (PS) indicate that the preprocessing method effectively reduced discrimination in our classification task while maintaining strong predictive performance. The model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 84.7%, demonstrating that PS did not significantly compromise predictive quality. Furthermore, the total true positive rate (TPR) of the model was around 82.8%, with minimal differences observed between the groups categorized as \"Older\" and \"Younger.\" Specifically, the \"Older\" group exhibited a TPR of approximately 83.2%, whereas the \"Younger\" group's TPR was about 82.6%. The False Positive Rates (FPR) for both groups were also closely aligned, with the \"Older\" group at approximately 14.9% and the \"Younger\" group slightly higher at around 15.1%. Importantly, the ratio of TPR between the two groups was 1.007, very close to an ideal value of 1, signifying almost no disparity in the model's positive classification performance between groups. The absolute difference in TPR between groups was also very small (0.006), further underscoring the effectiveness of Preferential Sampling in significantly reducing discriminatory bias in our predictions.\n",

    "Preferential Sampling (PS) ended up being the most effective intervention we tested, especially when compared to our earlier attempts at dataset-based (pre-processing), model-based (in-processing), and post-processing interventions. Previously, our dataset-based method helped reduce bias by mainly lowering the TPR for the older group, but it did not significantly raise the younger group's TPR, which isn't ideal. The model-based intervention addressed this issue by boosting the younger group's TPR without negatively impacting the older group's performance. Post-processing, on the other hand, increased both groups' TPR substantially but did so by significantly raising false positives, ultimately reducing the overall accuracy and efficiency of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferential Sampling stood out because it achieved the best balance overall: it minimized the difference in true positive rates between the older and younger groups to almost zero (only about 0.006 absolute difference), and it maintained a high total accuracy of approximately 84.7%. Importantly, PS didn't just improve fairness at the cost of accuracy or efficiency—false positive rates stayed low for both groups. This means we weren't unnecessarily misclassifying customers and wasting resources, a critical practical consideration for the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, PS was particularly effective for this task because it targeted borderline cases—those most likely impacted by bias—and balanced the dataset effectively before training the model. Unlike our post-processing intervention, it didn’t artificially inflate positive rates at the expense of accuracy, and unlike our dataset-based intervention from previous assignments, it didn't harm the performance of one group significantly. Therefore, if the bank had to pick just one intervention strategy, Preferential Sampling would likely be the most beneficial in practice. "
